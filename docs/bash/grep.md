## 1 Introduction[ ¶](#Introduction-1)

Given one or more patterns, `grep` searches input files
for matches to the patterns.
When it finds a match in a line,
it copies the line to standard output (by default),
or produces whatever other sort of output you have requested with options.

Though `grep` expects to do the matching on text,
it has no limits on input line length other than available memory,
and it can match arbitrary characters within a line.
If the final byte of an input file is not a newline,
`grep` silently supplies one.
Since newline is also a separator for the list of patterns,
there is no way to match newline characters in a text.

## 2 Invoking `grep`[ ¶](#Invoking-grep)

The general synopsis of the `grep` command line is

grep [option]... [patterns] [file]...

There can be zero or more option arguments, and zero or more
file arguments.  The patterns argument contains one or
more patterns separated by newlines, and is omitted when patterns are
given via the ‘-e patterns’ or ‘-f file’
options.  Typically patterns should be quoted when
`grep` is used in a shell command.

### 2.1 Command-line Options[ ¶](#Command_002dline-Options-1)

`grep` comes with a rich set of options:
some from POSIX and some being GNU extensions.
Long option names are always a GNU extension,
even for options that are from POSIX specifications.
Options that are specified by POSIX,
under their short names,
are explicitly marked as such
to facilitate POSIX-portable programming.
A few option names are provided
for compatibility with older or more exotic implementations.

Several additional options control
which variant of the `grep` matching engine is used.
See [`grep` Programs](#grep-Programs).

- [Generic Program Information](#Generic-Program-Information)

- [Matching Control](#Matching-Control)

- [General Output Control](#General-Output-Control)

- [Output Line Prefix Control](#Output-Line-Prefix-Control)

- [Context Line Control](#Context-Line-Control)

- [File and Directory Selection](#File-and-Directory-Selection)

- [Other Options](#Other-Options)

Next: [Matching Control](#Matching-Control), Up: [Command-line Options](#Command_002dline-Options)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

#### 2.1.1 Generic Program Information[ ¶](#Generic-Program-Information-1)

--help[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dhelp)

Print a usage message briefly summarizing the command-line options
and the bug-reporting address, then exit.

-V[ ¶](#index-_002dV)
--version

Print the version number of `grep` to the standard output stream.
This version number should be included in all bug reports.

Next: [General Output Control](#General-Output-Control), Previous: [Generic Program Information](#Generic-Program-Information), Up: [Command-line Options](#Command_002dline-Options)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

#### 2.1.2 Matching Control[ ¶](#Matching-Control-1)

-e patterns[ ¶](#index-_002de)
--regexp=patterns

Use patterns as one or more patterns; newlines within
patterns separate each pattern from the next.
If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the
-f (--file) option, search for all patterns given.
Typically patterns should be quoted when `grep` is used
in a shell command.
(-e is specified by POSIX.)

-f file[ ¶](#index-_002df)
--file=file

Obtain patterns from file, one per line.
If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the
-e (--regexp) option, search for all patterns given.
When file is ‘-’, read patterns from standard input.
The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.
(-f is specified by POSIX.)

-i[ ¶](#index-_002di)
-y
--ignore-case

Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data,
so that characters that differ only in case
match each other.  Although this is straightforward when letters
differ in case only via lowercase-uppercase pairs, the behavior is
unspecified in other situations.  For example, uppercase “S” has an
unusual lowercase counterpart
“Å¿”
(Unicode character U+017F LATIN
SMALL LETTER LONG S) in many locales, and it is unspecified whether
this unusual character matches “S” or “s” even though uppercasing
it yields “S”.  Another example: the lowercase German letter “Ã”
(U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) is normally capitalized as the
two-character string “SS” but it does not match “SS”, and it might
not match the uppercase letter
“áº”
(U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
SHARP S) even though lowercasing the latter yields the former.

-y is an obsolete synonym that is provided for compatibility.
(-i is specified by POSIX.)

--no-ignore-case[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dno_002dignore_002dcase)

Do not ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data.  This is
the default.  This option is useful for passing to shell scripts that
already use -i, in order to cancel its effects because the
two options override each other.

-v[ ¶](#index-_002dv)
--invert-match

Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
(-v is specified by POSIX.)

-w[ ¶](#index-_002dw)
--word-regexp

Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
The test is that the matching substring must either
be at the beginning of the line,
or preceded by a non-word constituent character.
Similarly,
it must be either at the end of the line
or followed by a non-word constituent character.
Word constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.
This option has no effect if -x is also specified.

Because the -w option can match a substring that does not
begin and end with word constituents, it differs from surrounding a
regular expression with ‘\<’ and ‘\>’.  For example, although
‘grep -w @’ matches a line containing only ‘@’, ‘grep
'\<@\>'’ cannot match any line because ‘@’ is not a
word constituent.  See [Special Backslash Expressions](#Special-Backslash-Expressions).

-x[ ¶](#index-_002dx)
--line-regexp

Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.
For regular expression patterns, this is like parenthesizing each
pattern and then surrounding it with ‘^’ and ‘$’.
(-x is specified by POSIX.)

Next: [Output Line Prefix Control](#Output-Line-Prefix-Control), Previous: [Matching Control](#Matching-Control), Up: [Command-line Options](#Command_002dline-Options)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

#### 2.1.3 General Output Control[ ¶](#General-Output-Control-1)

-c[ ¶](#index-_002dc)
--count

Suppress normal output;
instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.
With the -v (--invert-match) option,
count non-matching lines.
(-c is specified by POSIX.)

--color[=WHEN][ ¶](#index-_002d_002dcolor)
--colour[=WHEN]

Surround matched non-empty strings, matching lines, context lines,
file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and separators (for fields and
groups of context lines) with escape sequences to display them in color
on the terminal.
The colors are defined by the environment variable `GREP_COLORS`
and default to ‘ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36’
for bold red matched text, magenta file names, green line numbers,
green byte offsets, cyan separators, and default terminal colors otherwise.
See [Environment Variables](#Environment-Variables).

WHEN is ‘always’ to use colors, ‘never’ to not use
colors, or ‘auto’ to use colors if standard output is associated
with a terminal device and the `TERM` environment variable’s value
suggests that the terminal supports colors.
Plain --color is treated like --color=auto;
if no --color option is given, the default is --color=never.

-L[ ¶](#index-_002dL)
--files-without-match

Suppress normal output;
instead print the name of each input file from which
no output would normally have been printed.

-l[ ¶](#index-_002dl)
--files-with-matches

Suppress normal output;
instead print the name of each input file from which
output would normally have been printed.
Scanning each input file stops upon first match.
(-l is specified by POSIX.)

-m num[ ¶](#index-_002dm)
--max-count=num

Stop after the first num selected lines.
If num is zero, `grep` stops right away without reading input.
A num of −1 is treated as infinity and `grep`
does not stop; this is the default.

If the input is standard input from a regular file,
and num selected lines are output,
`grep` ensures that the standard input is positioned
just after the last selected line before exiting,
regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.
This enables a calling process to resume a search.
For example, the following shell script makes use of it:

while grep -m 1 'PATTERN'
do
  echo xxxx
done < FILE

But the following probably will not work because a pipe is not a regular
file:

# This probably will not work.
cat FILE |
while grep -m 1 'PATTERN'
do
  echo xxxx
done

When `grep` stops after num selected lines,
it outputs any trailing context lines.
When the -c or --count option is also used,
`grep` does not output a count greater than num.
When the -v or --invert-match option is also used,
`grep` stops after outputting num non-matching lines.

-o[ ¶](#index-_002do)
--only-matching

Print only the matched non-empty parts of matching lines,
with each such part on a separate output line.
Output lines use the same delimiters as input, and delimiters are null
bytes if -z (--null-data) is also used (see [Other Options](#Other-Options)).

-q[ ¶](#index-_002dq)
--quiet
--silent

Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.
Exit immediately with zero status if any match is found,
even if an error was detected.
Also see the -s or --no-messages option.
Portability note: Solaris 10 `grep` lacks -q;
portable shell scripts typically can redirect standard output to
/dev/null instead of using -q.
(-q is specified by POSIX.)

-s[ ¶](#index-_002ds)
--no-messages

Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.
(-s is specified by POSIX.)

#### 2.1.4 Output Line Prefix Control[ ¶](#Output-Line-Prefix-Control-1)

When several prefix fields are to be output,
the order is always file name, line number, and byte offset,
regardless of the order in which these options were specified.

-b[ ¶](#index-_002db)
--byte-offset

Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file
before each line of output.
If -o (--only-matching) is specified,
print the offset of the matching part itself.

-H[ ¶](#index-_002dH)
--with-filename

Print the file name for each match.
This is the default when there is more than one file to search.

-h[ ¶](#index-_002dh)
--no-filename

Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.
This is the default when there is only one file
(or only standard input) to search.

--label=LABEL[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dlabel)

Display input actually coming from standard input
as input coming from file LABEL.
This can be useful for commands that transform a file’s contents
before searching; e.g.:

gzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H 'some pattern'

-n[ ¶](#index-_002dn)
--line-number

Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.
(-n is specified by POSIX.)

-T[ ¶](#index-_002dT)
--initial-tab

Make sure that the first character of actual line content lies on a tab stop,
so that the alignment of tabs looks normal.
This is useful with options that prefix their output to the actual content:
-H, -n, and -b.
This may also prepend spaces to output line numbers and byte offsets
so that lines from a single file all start at the same column.

-Z[ ¶](#index-_002dZ)
--null

Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character)
instead of the character that normally follows a file name.
For example,
‘grep -lZ’ outputs a zero byte after each file name
instead of the usual newline.
This option makes the output unambiguous,
even in the presence of file names containing unusual characters like newlines.
This option can be used with commands like
‘find -print0’, ‘perl -0’, ‘sort -z’, and ‘xargs -0’
to process arbitrary file names,
even those that contain newline characters.

#### 2.1.5 Context Line Control[ ¶](#Context-Line-Control-1)

Context lines are non-matching lines that are near a matching line.
They are output only if one of the following options are used.
Regardless of how these options are set,
`grep` never outputs any given line more than once.
If the -o (--only-matching) option is specified,
these options have no effect and a warning is given upon their use.

-A num[ ¶](#index-_002dA)
--after-context=num

Print num lines of trailing context after matching lines.

-B num[ ¶](#index-_002dB)
--before-context=num

Print num lines of leading context before matching lines.

-C num[ ¶](#index-_002dC)
-num
--context=num

Print num lines of leading and trailing output context.

--group-separator=string[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dgroup_002dseparator)

When -A, -B or -C are in use,
print string instead of ‘--’ between groups of lines.

--no-group-separator[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dgroup_002dseparator-1)

When -A, -B or -C are in use,
do not print a separator between groups of lines.

Here are some points about how `grep` chooses
the separator to print between prefix fields and line content:

- Matching lines normally use ‘:’ as a separator
between prefix fields and actual line content.

- Context (i.e., non-matching) lines use ‘-’ instead.

- When context is not specified,
matching lines are simply output one right after another.

- When context is specified,
lines that are adjacent in the input form a group
and are output one right after another, while
by default a separator appears between non-adjacent groups.

- The default separator
is a ‘--’ line; its presence and appearance
can be changed with the options above.

- Each group may contain
several matching lines when they are close enough to each other
that two adjacent groups connect and can merge into a single
contiguous one.

#### 2.1.6 File and Directory Selection[ ¶](#File-and-Directory-Selection-1)

-a[ ¶](#index-_002da)
--text

Process a binary file as if it were text;
this is equivalent to the ‘--binary-files=text’ option.

--binary-files=type[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dbinary_002dfiles)

If a file’s data or metadata
indicate that the file contains binary data,
assume that the file is of type type.
Non-text bytes indicate binary data; these are either output bytes that are
improperly encoded for the current locale (see [Environment Variables](#Environment-Variables)), or null input bytes when the
-z (--null-data) option is not given (see [Other Options](#Other-Options)).

By default, type is ‘binary’, and `grep`
suppresses output after null input binary data is discovered,
and suppresses output lines that contain improperly encoded data.
When some output is suppressed, `grep` follows any output
with a message to standard error saying that a binary file matches.

If type is ‘without-match’,
when `grep` discovers null binary data in an input file
it assumes that any unprocessed input does not match;
this is equivalent to the -I option.
In this case the region of unprocessed input starts no later than the
null binary data, and continues to end of file.

If type is ‘text’,
`grep` processes binary data as if it were text;
this is equivalent to the -a option.

When type is ‘binary’, `grep` may treat non-text
bytes as line terminators even without the -z
(--null-data) option.  This means choosing ‘binary’
versus ‘text’ can affect whether a pattern matches a file.  For
example, when type is ‘binary’ the pattern ‘q$’ might
match ‘q’ immediately followed by a null byte, even though this
is not matched when type is ‘text’.  Conversely, when
type is ‘binary’ the pattern ‘.’ (period) might not
match a null byte.

The heuristic that `grep` uses to intuit whether input is
binary is specific to `grep` and may well be unsuitable for
other applications, as it depends on command-line options, on locale,
and on hardware and operating system characteristics such as system
page size and input buffering.  For example, if the input consists of
a matching text line followed by nonmatching data that contains a null
byte, `grep` might either output the matching line or treat
the file as binary, depending on whether the unprocessed input happens
to include the matching text line.

Warning: The -a (--binary-files=text) option
might output binary garbage, which can have nasty side effects if the
output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some of it
as commands.  On the other hand, when reading files whose text
encodings are unknown, it can be helpful to use -a or to set
‘LC_ALL='C'’ in the environment, in order to find more matches
even if the matches are unsafe for direct display.

-D action[ ¶](#index-_002dD)
--devices=action

If an input file is a device, FIFO, or socket, use action to process it.
If action is ‘read’,
all devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.
If action is ‘skip’,
devices, FIFOs, and sockets are silently skipped.
By default, devices are read if they are on the command line or if the
-R (--dereference-recursive) option is used, and are
skipped if they are encountered recursively and the -r
(--recursive) option is used.
This option has no effect on a file that is read via standard input.

-d action[ ¶](#index-_002dd)
--directories=action

If an input file is a directory, use action to process it.
By default, action is ‘read’,
which means that directories are read just as if they were ordinary files
(some operating systems and file systems disallow this,
and will cause `grep`
to print error messages for every directory or silently skip them).
If action is ‘skip’, directories are silently skipped.
If action is ‘recurse’,
`grep` reads all files under each directory, recursively,
following command-line symbolic links and skipping other symlinks;
this is equivalent to the -r option.

--exclude=glob[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dexclude)

Skip any command-line file with a name suffix that matches the pattern
glob, using wildcard matching; a name suffix is either the whole
name, or a trailing part that starts with a non-slash character
immediately after a slash (‘/’) in the name.
When searching recursively, skip any subfile whose base
name matches glob; the base name is the part after the last
slash.  A pattern can use
‘*’, ‘?’, and ‘[’…‘]’ as wildcards,
and `\` to quote a wildcard or backslash character literally.

--exclude-from=file[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dexclude_002dfrom)

Skip files whose name matches any of the patterns
read from file (using wildcard matching as described
under --exclude).

--exclude-dir=glob[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dexclude_002ddir)

Skip any command-line directory with a name suffix that matches the
pattern glob.  When searching recursively, skip any subdirectory
whose base name matches glob.  Ignore any redundant trailing
slashes in glob.

-I

Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data;
this is equivalent to the ‘--binary-files=without-match’ option.

--include=glob[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dinclude)

Search only files whose name matches glob,
using wildcard matching as described under --exclude.
If contradictory --include and --exclude options are
given, the last matching one wins.  If no --include or
--exclude options match, a file is included unless the first
such option is --include.

-r[ ¶](#index-_002dr)
--recursive

For each directory operand,
read and process all files in that directory, recursively.
Follow symbolic links on the command line, but skip symlinks
that are encountered recursively.
Note that if no file operand is given, grep searches the working directory.
This is the same as the ‘--directories=recurse’ option.

-R[ ¶](#index-_002dR)
--dereference-recursive

For each directory operand, read and process all files in that
directory, recursively, following all symbolic links.

Previous: [File and Directory Selection](#File-and-Directory-Selection), Up: [Command-line Options](#Command_002dline-Options)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

#### 2.1.7 Other Options[ ¶](#Other-Options-1)

--[ ¶](#index-_002d_002d)

Delimit the option list.  Any later argument is not treated as an
option even if it begins with ‘-’.  For example,
‘grep -- -PAT -file1 file2’ searches for the pattern ‘-PAT’
in the files named -file1 and file2.

--line-buffered[ ¶](#index-_002d_002dline_002dbuffered)

Use line buffering for standard output, regardless of output device.
By default, standard output is line buffered for interactive devices,
and is fully buffered otherwise.  With full buffering, the output
buffer is flushed when full; with line buffering, the buffer is also
flushed after every output line.  The buffer size is system dependent.

-U[ ¶](#index-_002dU)
--binary

On platforms that distinguish between text and binary I/O,
use the latter when reading and writing files other
than the user’s terminal, so that all input bytes are read and written
as-is.  This overrides the default behavior where `grep`
follows the operating system’s advice whether to use text or binary
I/O.  On MS-Windows when `grep` uses text I/O it reads a
carriage return–newline pair as a newline and a Control-Z as
end-of-file, and it writes a newline as a carriage return–newline
pair.

When using text I/O --byte-offset (-b) counts and
--binary-files heuristics apply to input data after text-I/O
processing.  Also, the --binary-files heuristics need not agree
with the --binary option; that is, they may treat the data as
text even if --binary is given, or vice versa.
See [File and Directory Selection](#File-and-Directory-Selection).

This option has no effect on GNU and other POSIX-compatible platforms,
which do not distinguish text from binary I/O.

-z[ ¶](#index-_002dz)
--null-data

Treat input and output data as sequences of lines, each terminated by
a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of a newline.
Like the -Z or --null option,
this option can be used with commands like
‘sort -z’ to process arbitrary file names.

### 2.2 Environment Variables[ ¶](#Environment-Variables-1)

The behavior of `grep` is affected by several environment
variables, the most important of which control the locale, which
specifies how `grep` interprets characters in its patterns and
data.

The locale for category `LC_foo`
is specified by examining the three environment variables
`LC_ALL`, `LC_foo`, and `LANG`,
in that order.
The first of these variables that is set specifies the locale.
For example, if `LC_ALL` is not set,
but `LC_COLLATE` is set to ‘pt_BR.UTF-8’,
then a Brazilian Portuguese locale is used
for the `LC_COLLATE` category.
As a special case for `LC_MESSAGES` only, the environment variable
`LANGUAGE` can contain a colon-separated list of languages that
overrides the three environment variables that ordinarily specify
the `LC_MESSAGES` category.
The ‘C’ locale is used if none of these environment variables are set,
if the locale catalog is not installed,
or if `grep` was not compiled
with national language support (NLS).
The shell command `locale -a` lists locales that are currently available.

The following environment variables affect the behavior of `grep`.

`GREP_COLOR`[ ¶](#index-GREP_005fCOLOR-environment-variable)

This obsolescent variable interacts with `GREP_COLORS`
confusingly, and `grep` warns if it is set and is not
overridden by `GREP_COLORS`.  Instead of
‘GREP_COLOR='color'’, you can use
‘GREP_COLORS='mt=color'’.

`GREP_COLORS`[ ¶](#index-GREP_005fCOLORS-environment-variable)

This variable controls how the --color option highlights output.
Its value is a colon-separated list of `terminfo` capabilities
that defaults to ‘ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36’
with the ‘rv’ and ‘ne’ boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).
The two-letter capability names
refer to terminal “capabilities,” the ability
of a terminal to highlight text, or change its color, and so on.
These capabilities are stored in an online database and accessed by
the `terminfo` library.
Non-empty capability values
control highlighting using
Select Graphic Rendition (SGR)
commands interpreted by the terminal or terminal emulator.
(See the
section
in the documentation of your text terminal
for permitted values and their meanings as character attributes.)
These substring values are integers in decimal representation
and can be concatenated with semicolons.
`grep` takes care of assembling the result
into a complete SGR sequence (‘\33[’…‘m’).
Common values to concatenate include
‘1’ for bold,
‘4’ for underline,
‘5’ for blink,
‘7’ for inverse,
‘39’ for default foreground color,
‘30’ to ‘37’ for foreground colors,
‘90’ to ‘97’ for 16-color mode foreground colors,
‘38;5;0’ to ‘38;5;255’
for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors,
‘49’ for default background color,
‘40’ to ‘47’ for background colors,
‘100’ to ‘107’ for 16-color mode background colors,
and ‘48;5;0’ to ‘48;5;255’
for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

Supported capabilities are as follows.

`sl=`[ ¶](#index-sl-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for whole selected lines
(i.e.,
matching lines when the -v command-line option is omitted,
or non-matching lines when -v is specified).
If however the boolean ‘rv’ capability
and the -v command-line option are both specified,
it applies to context matching lines instead.
The default is empty (i.e., the terminal’s default color pair).

`cx=`[ ¶](#index-cx-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for whole context lines
(i.e.,
non-matching lines when the -v command-line option is omitted,
or matching lines when -v is specified).
If however the boolean ‘rv’ capability
and the -v command-line option are both specified,
it applies to selected non-matching lines instead.
The default is empty (i.e., the terminal’s default color pair).

`rv`[ ¶](#index-rv-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

Boolean value that reverses (swaps) the meanings of
the ‘sl=’ and ‘cx=’ capabilities
when the -v command-line option is specified.
The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

`mt=01;31`[ ¶](#index-mt-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching line
(i.e.,
a selected line when the -v command-line option is omitted,
or a context line when -v is specified).
Setting this is equivalent to setting both ‘ms=’ and ‘mc=’
at once to the same value.
The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

`ms=01;31`[ ¶](#index-ms-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a selected line.
(This is used only when the -v command-line option is omitted.)
The effect of the ‘sl=’ (or ‘cx=’ if ‘rv’) capability
remains active when this takes effect.
The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

`mc=01;31`[ ¶](#index-mc-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a context line.
(This is used only when the -v command-line option is specified.)
The effect of the ‘cx=’ (or ‘sl=’ if ‘rv’) capability
remains active when this takes effect.
The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

`fn=35`[ ¶](#index-fn-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for file names prefixing any content line.
The default is a magenta text foreground over the terminal’s default background.

`ln=32`[ ¶](#index-ln-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content line.
The default is a green text foreground over the terminal’s default background.

`bn=32`[ ¶](#index-bn-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

SGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any content line.
The default is a green text foreground over the terminal’s default background.

`se=36`[ ¶](#index-fn-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability-1)

SGR substring for separators that are inserted
between selected line fields (‘:’),
between context line fields (‘-’),
and between groups of adjacent lines
when nonzero context is specified (‘--’).
The default is a cyan text foreground over the terminal’s default background.

`ne`[ ¶](#index-ne-GREP_005fCOLORS-capability)

Boolean value that prevents clearing to the end of line
using Erase in Line (EL) to Right (‘\33[K’)
each time a colorized item ends.
This is needed on terminals on which EL is not supported.
It is otherwise useful on terminals
for which the `back_color_erase`
(`bce`) boolean `terminfo` capability does not apply,
when the chosen highlight colors do not affect the background,
or when EL is too slow or causes too much flicker.
The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

Note that boolean capabilities have no ‘=’… part.
They are omitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when specified.

`LC_ALL`[ ¶](#index-LC_005fALL-environment-variable-1)
`LC_COLLATE`
`LANG`

These variables specify the locale for the `LC_COLLATE` category,
which might affect how range expressions like ‘a-z’ are
interpreted.

`LC_ALL`[ ¶](#index-LC_005fALL-environment-variable-2)
`LC_CTYPE`
`LANG`

These variables specify the locale for the `LC_CTYPE` category,
which determines the type of characters,
e.g., which characters are whitespace.
This category also determines the character encoding.
See [Character Encoding](#Character-Encoding).

`LANGUAGE`[ ¶](#index-LANGUAGE-environment-variable-1)
`LC_ALL`
`LC_MESSAGES`
`LANG`

These variables specify the locale for the `LC_MESSAGES` category,
which determines the language that `grep` uses for messages.
The default ‘C’ locale uses American English messages.

`POSIXLY_CORRECT`[ ¶](#index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-environment-variable)

If set, `grep` behaves as POSIX requires; otherwise,
`grep` behaves more like other GNU programs.
POSIX
requires that options that
follow file names must be treated as file names;
by default,
such options are permuted to the front of the operand list
and are treated as options.

`TERM`[ ¶](#index-TERM-environment-variable)

This variable specifies the output terminal type, which can affect
what the --color option does.  See [General Output Control](#General-Output-Control).

The `GREP_OPTIONS` environment variable of `grep` 2.20 and
earlier is no longer supported, as it caused problems when writing
portable scripts.  To make arbitrary changes to how `grep`
works, you can use an alias or script instead.  For example, if
`grep` is in the directory ‘/usr/bin’ you can prepend
$HOME/bin to your `PATH` and create an executable script
$HOME/bin/grep containing the following:

#! /bin/sh
export PATH=/usr/bin
exec grep --color=auto --devices=skip "$@"

### 2.3 Exit Status[ ¶](#Exit-Status-1)

Normally the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines
were selected, and 2 if an error occurred.  However, if the
-q or --quiet or --silent option is used
and a line is selected, the exit status is 0 even if an error
occurred.  Other `grep` implementations may exit with status
greater than 2 on error.

Previous: [Exit Status](#Exit-Status), Up: [Invoking `grep`](#Invoking)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

### 2.4 `grep` Programs[ ¶](#grep-Programs-1)

`grep` searches the named input files
for lines containing a match to the given patterns.
By default, `grep` prints the matching lines.
A file named - stands for standard input.
If no input is specified, `grep` searches the working
directory . if given a command-line option specifying
recursion; otherwise, `grep` searches standard input.
There are four major variants of `grep`,
controlled by the following options.

-G[ ¶](#index-_002dG)
--basic-regexp

Interpret patterns as basic regular expressions (BREs).
This is the default.

-E[ ¶](#index-_002dE)
--extended-regexp

Interpret patterns as extended regular expressions (EREs).
(-E is specified by POSIX.)

-F[ ¶](#index-_002dF)
--fixed-strings

Interpret patterns as fixed strings, not regular expressions.
(-F is specified by POSIX.)

-P[ ¶](#index-_002dP)
--perl-regexp

Interpret patterns as Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCREs).

For documentation, refer to [https://www.pcre.org/](https://www.pcre.org/), with these caveats:

- In a UTF-8 locale, Perl treats data as UTF-8 only under certain
conditions, e.g., if `perl` is invoked with the -C
option or the `PERL_UNICODE` environment variable set appropriately.
Similarly, `pcre2grep` treats data as UTF-8 only if
invoked with -u or -U.
In contrast, in a UTF-8 locale `grep` and `git grep`
always treat data as UTF-8.

- In Perl and `git grep -P`, ‘\d’ matches all Unicode digits,
even if they are not ASCII.
For example, ‘\d’ matches
“Ù£”
(U+0663 ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT THREE).
In contrast, in ‘grep -P’, ‘\d’ matches only
the ten ASCII digits, regardless of locale.
In `pcre2grep`, ‘\d’ ordinarily behaves like Perl and
`git grep -P`, but when given the --posix-digit option
it behaves like ‘grep -P’.
(On all platforms, ‘\D’ matches the complement of ‘\d’.)

- The pattern ‘[[:digit:]]’ matches all Unicode digits
in Perl, ‘grep -P’, `git grep -P`, and `pcre2grep`,
so you can use it
to get the effect of Perl’s ‘\d’ on all these platforms.
In other words, in Perl and `git grep -P`,
‘\d’ is equivalent to ‘[[:digit:]]’,
whereas in ‘grep -P’, ‘\d’ is equivalent to ‘[0-9]’,
and `pcre2grep` ordinarily follows Perl but
when given --posix-digit it follows ‘grep -P’.

(On all these platforms, ‘[[:digit:]]’ is equivalent to ‘\p{Nd}’
and to ‘\p{General_Category: Decimal_Number}’.)

- If `grep` is built with PCRE2 version 10.43 (2024) or later,
‘(?aD)’ causes ‘\d’ to behave like ‘[0-9]’ and
‘(?-aD)’ causes it to behave like ‘[[:digit:]]’.

- Although PCRE tracks the syntax and semantics of Perl’s regular
expressions, the match is not always exact.  Perl
evolves and a Perl installation may predate or postdate the PCRE2
installation on the same host, or their Unicode versions may differ,
or Perl and PCRE2 may disagree about an obscure construct.

- By default, `grep` applies each regexp to a line at a time,
so the ‘(?s)’ directive (making ‘.’ match line breaks)
is generally ineffective.
However, with -z (--null-data) it can work:

$ printf 'a\nb\n' |grep -zP '(?s)a.b'
a
b

But beware: with the -z (--null-data) and a file
containing no NUL byte, grep must read the entire file into memory
before processing any of it.
Thus, it will exhaust memory and fail for some large files.

## 3 Regular Expressions[ ¶](#Regular-Expressions-1)

A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions,
by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.
`grep` understands
three different versions of regular expression syntax:
basic (BRE), extended (ERE), and Perl-compatible (PCRE).
In GNU `grep`,
basic and extended regular expressions are merely different notations
for the same pattern-matching functionality.
In other implementations, basic regular expressions are ordinarily
less powerful than extended, though occasionally it is the other way around.
The following description applies to extended regular expressions;
differences for basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.
Perl-compatible regular expressions have different functionality, and
are documented in the pcre2syntax(3) and pcre2pattern(3) manual
pages, but work only if PCRE is available in the system.

### 3.1 Fundamental Structure[ ¶](#Fundamental-Structure-1)

In regular expressions, the characters ‘.?*+{|()[\^$’ are
special characters and have uses described below.  All other
characters are ordinary characters, and each ordinary character
is a regular expression that matches itself.

The period ‘.’ matches any single character.
It is unspecified whether ‘.’ matches an encoding error.

A regular expression may be followed by one of several
repetition operators; the operators beginning with ‘{’
are called interval expressions.

‘?’[ ¶](#index-_003f)

The preceding item is optional and is matched at most once.

‘*’[ ¶](#index-_002a)

The preceding item is matched zero or more times.

‘+’[ ¶](#index-_002b)

The preceding item is matched one or more times.

‘{n}’[ ¶](#index-_007bn_007d)

The preceding item is matched exactly n times.

‘{n,}’[ ¶](#index-_007bn_002c_007d)

The preceding item is matched n or more times.

‘{,m}’[ ¶](#index-_007b_002cm_007d)

The preceding item is matched at most m times.
This is a GNU extension.

‘{n,m}’[ ¶](#index-_007bn_002cm_007d)

The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than
m times.

The empty regular expression matches the empty string.
Two regular expressions may be concatenated;
the resulting regular expression
matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
that respectively match the concatenated expressions.

Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator ‘|’.
The resulting regular expression matches any string matching either of
the two expressions, which are called alternatives.

Repetition takes precedence over concatenation,
which in turn takes precedence over alternation.
A whole expression may be enclosed in parentheses
to override these precedence rules and form a subexpression.
An unmatched ‘)’ matches just itself.

Not every character string is a valid regular expression.
See [Problematic Regular Expressions](#Problematic-Expressions).

Next: [Special Backslash Expressions](#Special-Backslash-Expressions), Previous: [Fundamental Structure](#Fundamental-Structure), Up: [Regular Expressions](#Regular-Expressions)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

### 3.2 Character Classes and Bracket Expressions[ ¶](#Character-Classes-and-Bracket-Expressions-1)

A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by ‘[’ and
‘]’.
It matches any single character in that list.
If the first character of the list is the caret ‘^’,
then it matches any character not in the list,
and it is unspecified whether it matches an encoding error.
For example, the regular expression
‘[0123456789]’ matches any single digit,
whereas ‘[^()]’ matches any single character that is not
an opening or closing parenthesis, and might or might not match an
encoding error.

Within a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two
characters separated by a hyphen.
In the default C locale, it matches any single character that appears
between the two characters in ASCII order, inclusive.
For example, ‘[a-d]’ is equivalent to ‘[abcd]’.
In other locales the behavior is unspecified:
‘[a-d]’ might be equivalent to
‘[abcd]’ or ‘[aBbCcDd]’ or some other bracket expression,
or it might fail to match any character, or the set of
characters that it matches might be erratic, or it might be invalid.
To obtain the traditional interpretation
of bracket expressions, you can use the ‘C’ locale by setting the
`LC_ALL` environment variable to the value ‘C’.

Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within
bracket expressions, as follows.
Their interpretation depends on the `LC_CTYPE` locale;
for example, ‘[[:alnum:]]’ means the character class of numbers and letters
in the current locale.

‘[:alnum:]’[ ¶](#index-alnum-character-class)

Alphanumeric characters:
‘[:alpha:]’ and ‘[:digit:]’; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII
character encoding, this is the same as ‘[0-9A-Za-z]’.

‘[:alpha:]’[ ¶](#index-alpha-character-class)

Alphabetic characters:
‘[:lower:]’ and ‘[:upper:]’; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII
character encoding, this is the same as ‘[A-Za-z]’.

‘[:blank:]’[ ¶](#index-blank-character-class)

Blank characters:
space and tab.

‘[:cntrl:]’[ ¶](#index-cntrl-character-class)

Control characters.
In ASCII, these characters have octal codes 000
through 037, and 177 (DEL).
In other character sets, these are
the equivalent characters, if any.

‘[:digit:]’[ ¶](#index-digit-character-class)

Digits: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`.

‘[:graph:]’[ ¶](#index-graph-character-class)

Graphical characters:
‘[:alnum:]’ and ‘[:punct:]’.

‘[:lower:]’[ ¶](#index-lower-character-class)

Lower-case letters; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character
encoding, this is
`a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z`.

‘[:print:]’[ ¶](#index-print-character-class)

Printable characters:
‘[:alnum:]’, ‘[:punct:]’, and space.

‘[:punct:]’[ ¶](#index-punct-character-class)

Punctuation characters; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character
encoding, this is
`! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~`.

‘[:space:]’[ ¶](#index-space-character-class)

Space characters: in the ‘C’ locale, this is
tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, and space.
See [Usage](#Usage), for more discussion of matching newlines.

‘[:upper:]’[ ¶](#index-upper-character-class)

Upper-case letters: in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character
encoding, this is
`A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`.

‘[:xdigit:]’[ ¶](#index-xdigit-character-class)

Hexadecimal digits:
`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f`.

Note that the brackets in these class names are
part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to
the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.

If you mistakenly omit the outer brackets, and search for say, ‘[:upper:]’,
GNU `grep` prints a diagnostic and exits with status 2, on
the assumption that you did not intend to search for the
regular expression ‘[:epru]’.

Special characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.

‘]’

ends the bracket expression if it’s not the first list item.
So, if you want to make the ‘]’ character a list item,
you must put it first.

‘[.’

represents the open collating symbol.

‘.]’

represents the close collating symbol.

‘[=’

represents the open equivalence class.

‘=]’

represents the close equivalence class.

‘[:’

represents the open character class symbol, and should be followed by a
valid character class name.

‘:]’

represents the close character class symbol.

‘-’

represents the range if it’s not first or last in a list or the ending point
of a range.  To make the ‘-’ a list item, it is best to put it last.

‘^’

represents the characters not in the list.
If you want to make the ‘^’
character a list item, place it anywhere but first.

### 3.3 Special Backslash Expressions[ ¶](#Special-Backslash-Expressions-1)

The ‘\’ character followed by a special character is a regular
expression that matches the special character.
The ‘\’ character,
when followed by certain ordinary characters,
takes a special meaning:

‘\b’

Match the empty string at the edge of a word.

‘\B’

Match the empty string provided it’s not at the edge of a word.

‘\<’

Match the empty string at the beginning of a word.

‘\>’

Match the empty string at the end of a word.

‘\w’

Match word constituent, it is a synonym for ‘[_[:alnum:]]’.

‘\W’

Match non-word constituent, it is a synonym for ‘[^_[:alnum:]]’.

‘\s’

Match whitespace, it is a synonym for ‘[[:space:]]’.

‘\S’

Match non-whitespace, it is a synonym for ‘[^[:space:]]’.

‘\]’

Match ‘]’.

‘\}’

Match ‘}’.

For example, ‘\brat\b’ matches the separate word ‘rat’,
‘\Brat\B’ matches ‘crate’ but not ‘furry rat’.

The behavior of `grep` is unspecified if a unescaped backslash
is not followed by a special character, a nonzero digit, or a
character in the above list.  Although `grep` might issue a
diagnostic and/or give the backslash an interpretation now, its
behavior may change if the syntax of regular expressions is extended
in future versions.

### 3.4 Anchoring[ ¶](#Anchoring-1)

The caret ‘^’ and the dollar sign ‘$’ are special characters that
respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.
They are termed anchors, since they force the match to be “anchored”
to beginning or end of a line, respectively.

Next: [Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions](#Basic-vs-Extended), Previous: [Anchoring](#Anchoring), Up: [Regular Expressions](#Regular-Expressions)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

### 3.5 Back-references and Subexpressions[ ¶](#Back_002dreferences-and-Subexpressions-1)

The back-reference ‘\n’,
where n is a single nonzero digit, matches
the substring previously matched by the nth parenthesized subexpression
of the regular expression.
For example, ‘(a)\1’ matches ‘aa’.
If the parenthesized subexpression does not participate in the match,
the back-reference makes the whole match fail;
for example, ‘(a)*\1’ fails to match ‘a’.
If the parenthesized subexpression matches more than one substring,
the back-reference refers to the last matched substring;
for example, ‘^(ab*)*\1$’ matches ‘ababbabb’ but not ‘ababbab’.
When multiple regular expressions are given with
-e or from a file (‘-f file’),
back-references are local to each expression.

See [Known Bugs](#Known-Bugs), for some known problems with back-references.

Next: [Problematic Regular Expressions](#Problematic-Expressions), Previous: [Back-references and Subexpressions](#Back_002dreferences-and-Subexpressions), Up: [Regular Expressions](#Regular-Expressions)   [[Contents](#SEC_Contents)][[Index](#Index)]

### 3.6 Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions[ ¶](#Basic-vs-Extended-Regular-Expressions)

Basic regular expressions differ from extended regular expressions
in the following ways:

- The characters ‘?’, ‘+’,
‘{’, ‘|’, ‘(’, and ‘)’ lose their special meaning;
instead use the backslashed versions ‘\?’, ‘\+’, ‘\{’,
‘\|’, ‘\(’, and ‘\)’.  Also, a backslash is needed
before an interval expression’s closing ‘}’.

- An unmatched ‘\)’ is invalid.

- If an unescaped ‘^’ appears neither first, nor directly after
‘\(’ or ‘\|’, it is treated like an ordinary character and
is not an anchor.

- If an unescaped ‘$’ appears neither last, nor directly before
‘\|’ or ‘\)’, it is treated like an ordinary character and
is not an anchor.

- If an unescaped ‘*’ appears first, or appears directly after
‘\(’ or ‘\|’ or anchoring ‘^’, it is treated like an
ordinary character and is not a repetition operator.

### 3.7 Problematic Regular Expressions[ ¶](#Problematic-Regular-Expressions)

Some strings are invalid regular expressions and cause
`grep` to issue a diagnostic and fail.  For example, ‘xy\1’
is invalid because there is no parenthesized subexpression for the
back-reference ‘\1’ to refer to.

Also, some regular expressions have unspecified behavior and
should be avoided even if `grep` does not currently diagnose
them.  For example, ‘xy\0’ has unspecified behavior because
‘0’ is not a special character and ‘\0’ is not a special
backslash expression (see [Special Backslash Expressions](#Special-Backslash-Expressions)).
Unspecified behavior can be particularly problematic because the set
of matched strings might be only partially specified, or not be
specified at all, or the expression might even be invalid.

The following regular expression constructs are invalid on all
platforms conforming to POSIX, so portable scripts can assume that
`grep` rejects these constructs:

- A basic regular expression containing a back-reference ‘\n’
preceded by fewer than n closing parentheses.  For example,
‘\(a\)\2’ is invalid.

- A bracket expression containing ‘[:’ that does not start a
character class; and similarly for ‘[=’ and ‘[.’.  For
example, ‘[a[:b]’ and ‘[a[:ouch:]b]’ are invalid.

GNU `grep` treats the following constructs as invalid.
However, other `grep` implementations might allow them, so
portable scripts should not rely on their being invalid:

- Unescaped ‘\’ at the end of a regular expression.

- Unescaped ‘[’ that does not start a bracket expression.

- A ‘\{’ in a basic regular expression that does not start an
interval expression.

- A basic regular expression with unbalanced ‘\(’ or ‘\)’,
or an extended regular expression with unbalanced ‘(’.

- In the POSIX locale, a range expression like ‘z-a’ that
represents zero elements.  A non-GNU `grep` might treat it as
a valid range that never matches.

- An interval expression with a repetition count greater than 32767.
(The portable POSIX limit is 255, and even interval expressions with
smaller counts can be impractically slow on all known implementations.)

- A bracket expression that contains at least three elements, the first
and last of which are both ‘:’, or both ‘.’, or both
‘=’.  For example, a non-GNU `grep` might treat
‘[:alpha:]’ like ‘[[:alpha:]]’, or like ‘[:ahlp]’.

The following constructs have well-defined behavior in GNU
`grep`.  However, they have unspecified behavior elsewhere, so
portable scripts should avoid them:

- Special backslash expressions like ‘\b’, ‘\<’, and ‘\]’.
See [Special Backslash Expressions](#Special-Backslash-Expressions).

- A basic regular expression that uses ‘\?’, ‘\+’, or ‘\|’.

- An extended regular expression that uses back-references.

- An empty regular expression, subexpression, or alternative.  For
example, ‘(a|bc|)’ is not portable; a portable equivalent is
‘(a|bc)?’.

- In a basic regular expression, an anchoring ‘^’ that appears
directly after ‘\(’, or an anchoring ‘$’ that appears
directly before ‘\)’.

- In a basic regular expression, a repetition operator that
directly follows another repetition operator.

- In an extended regular expression, unescaped ‘{’
that does not begin a valid interval expression.
GNU `grep` treats the ‘{’ as an ordinary character.

- A null character or an encoding error in either pattern or input data.
See [Character Encoding](#Character-Encoding).

- An input file that ends in a non-newline character,
where GNU `grep` silently supplies a newline.

The following constructs have unspecified behavior, in both GNU
and other `grep` implementations.  Scripts should avoid
them whenever possible.

- A backslash escaping an ordinary character, unless it is a
back-reference like ‘\1’ or a special backslash expression like
‘\<’ or ‘\b’.  See [Special Backslash Expressions](#Special-Backslash-Expressions).  For
example, ‘\x’ has unspecified behavior now, and a future version
of `grep` might specify ‘\x’ to have a new behavior.

- A repetition operator that appears directly after an anchor, or at the
start of a complete regular expression, parenthesized subexpression,
or alternative.  For example, ‘+|^*(+a|?-b)’ has unspecified
behavior, whereas ‘\+|^\*(\+a|\?-b)’ is portable.

- A range expression outside the POSIX locale.  For example, in some
locales ‘[a-z]’ might match some characters that are not
lowercase letters, or might not match some lowercase letters, or might
be invalid.  With GNU `grep` it is not documented whether
these range expressions use native code points, or use the collation
sequence specified by the `LC_COLLATE` category, or use the
collation ordering used by `sort` and `strcoll`, or have some
other interpretation.  Outside the POSIX locale, it is portable to use
‘[[:lower:]]’ to match a lower-case letter, or
‘[abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]’ to match an ASCII lower-case
letter.

### 3.8 Character Encoding[ ¶](#Character-Encoding-1)

The `LC_CTYPE` locale specifies the encoding of characters in
patterns and data, that is, whether text is encoded in UTF-8, ASCII,
or some other encoding.  See [Environment Variables](#Environment-Variables).

In the ‘C’ or ‘POSIX’ locale, every character is encoded as
a single byte and every byte is a valid character.  In more-complex
encodings such as UTF-8, a sequence of multiple bytes may be needed to
represent a character, and some bytes may be encoding errors that do
not contribute to the representation of any character.  POSIX does not
specify the behavior of `grep` when patterns or input data
contain encoding errors or null characters, so portable scripts should
avoid such usage.  As an extension to POSIX, GNU `grep` treats
null characters like any other character.  However, unless the
-a (--binary-files=text) option is used, the
presence of null characters in input or of encoding errors in output
causes GNU `grep` to treat the file as binary and suppress
details about matches.  See [File and Directory Selection](#File-and-Directory-Selection).

Regardless of locale, the 103 characters in the POSIX Portable
Character Set (a subset of ASCII) are always encoded as a single byte,
and the 128 ASCII characters have their usual single-byte encodings on
all but oddball platforms.

### 3.9 Matching Non-ASCII and Non-printable Characters[ ¶](#Matching-Non_002dASCII-and-Non_002dprintable-Characters)

In a regular expression, non-ASCII and non-printable characters other
than newline are not special, and represent themselves.  For example,
in a locale using UTF-8 the command ‘grep 'Î Ï'’ (where the
white space between ‘Î’ and the ‘Ï’ is a tab character)
searches for ‘Î’ (Unicode character U+039B GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
LAMBDA), followed by a tab (U+0009 TAB), followed by ‘Ï’ (U+03C9
GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA).

Suppose you want to limit your pattern to only printable characters
(or even only printable ASCII characters) to keep your script readable
or portable, but you also want to match specific non-ASCII or non-null
non-printable characters.  If you are using the -P
(--perl-regexp) option, PCREs give you several ways to do
this.  Otherwise, if you are using Bash, the GNU project’s shell, you
can represent these characters via ANSI-C quoting.  For example, the
Bash commands ‘grep $'Î\tÏ'’ and ‘grep $'\u039B\t\u03C9'’
both search for the same three-character string ‘Î Ï’
mentioned earlier.  However, because Bash translates ANSI-C quoting
before `grep` sees the pattern, this technique should not be
used to match printable ASCII characters; for example, ‘grep
$'\u005E'’ is equivalent to ‘grep '^'’ and matches any line, not
just lines containing the character ‘^’ (U+005E CIRCUMFLEX
ACCENT).

Since PCREs and ANSI-C quoting are GNU extensions to POSIX, portable
shell scripts written in ASCII should use other methods to match
specific non-ASCII characters.  For example, in a UTF-8 locale the
command ‘grep "$(printf '\316\233\t\317\211\n')"’ is a portable
albeit hard-to-read alternative to Bash’s ‘grep $'Î\tÏ'’.
However, none of these techniques will let you put a null character
directly into a command-line pattern; null characters can appear only
in a pattern specified via the -f (--file) option.

## 4 Usage[ ¶](#Usage-1)

Here is an example command that invokes GNU `grep`:

grep -i 'hello.*world' menu.h main.c

This lists all lines in the files menu.h and main.c that
contain the string ‘hello’ followed by the string ‘world’;
this is because ‘.*’ matches zero or more characters within a line.
See [Regular Expressions](#Regular-Expressions).
The -i option causes `grep`
to ignore case, causing it to match the line ‘Hello, world!’, which
it would not otherwise match.

Here is a more complex example,
showing the location and contents of any line
containing ‘f’ and ending in ‘.c’,
within all files in the current directory whose names
start with non-‘.’, contain ‘g’, and end in ‘.h’.
The -n option outputs line numbers, the -- argument
treats any later arguments as file names not options even if
`*g*.h` expands to a file name that starts with ‘-’,
and the empty file /dev/null causes file names to be output
even if only one file name happens to be of the form ‘*g*.h’.

grep -n -- 'f.*\.c$' *g*.h /dev/null

Note that the regular expression syntax used in the pattern differs
from the globbing syntax that the shell uses to match file names.

See [Invoking `grep`](#Invoking), for more details about
how to invoke `grep`.

Here are some common questions and answers about `grep` usage.

-  How can I list just the names of matching files?

grep -l 'main' test-*.c

lists names of ‘test-*.c’ files in the current directory whose contents
mention ‘main’.

-  How do I search directories recursively?

grep -r 'hello' /home/gigi

searches for ‘hello’ in all files
under the /home/gigi directory.
For more control over which files are searched,
use `find` and `grep`.
For example, the following command searches only C files:

find /home/gigi -name '*.c' ! -type d \
  -exec grep -H 'hello' '{}' +

This differs from the command:

grep -H 'hello' /home/gigi/*.c

which merely looks for ‘hello’ in non-hidden C files in
/home/gigi whose names end in ‘.c’.
The `find` command line above is more similar to the command:

grep -r --include='*.c' 'hello' /home/gigi

-  What if a pattern or file has a leading ‘-’?
For example:

grep "$pattern" *

can behave unexpectedly if the value of ‘pattern’ begins with ‘-’,
or if the ‘*’ expands to a file name with leading ‘-’.
To avoid the problem, you can use -e for patterns and leading
‘./’ for files:

grep -e "$pattern" ./*

searches for all lines matching the pattern in all the working
directory’s files whose names do not begin with ‘.’.
Without the -e, `grep` might treat the pattern as an
option if it begins with ‘-’.  Without the ‘./’, there might
be similar problems with file names beginning with ‘-’.

Alternatively, you can use ‘--’ before the pattern and file names:

grep -- "$pattern" *

This also fixes the problem, except that if there is a file named ‘-’,
`grep` misinterprets the ‘-’ as standard input.

-  Suppose I want to search for a whole word, not a part of a word?

grep -w 'hello' test*.log

searches only for instances of ‘hello’ that are entire words;
it does not match ‘Othello’.
For more control, use ‘\<’ and
‘\>’ to match the start and end of words.
For example:

grep 'hello\>' test*.log

searches only for words ending in ‘hello’, so it matches the word
‘Othello’.

-  How do I output context around the matching lines?

grep -C 2 'hello' test*.log

prints two lines of context around each matching line.

-  How do I force `grep` to print the name of the file?

Append /dev/null:

grep 'eli' /etc/passwd /dev/null

gets you:

/etc/passwd:eli:x:2098:1000:Eli Smith:/home/eli:/bin/bash

Alternatively, use -H, which is a GNU extension:

grep -H 'eli' /etc/passwd

-  Why do people use strange regular expressions on `ps` output?

ps -ef | grep '[c]ron'

If the pattern had been written without the square brackets, it would
have matched not only the `ps` output line for `cron`,
but also the `ps` output line for `grep`.
Note that on some platforms,
`ps` limits the output to the width of the screen;
`grep` does not have any limit on the length of a line
except the available memory.

-  Why does `grep` report “binary file matches”?

If `grep` listed all matching “lines” from a binary file, it
would probably generate output that is not useful, and it might even
muck up your display.
So GNU `grep` suppresses output from
files that appear to be binary files.
To force GNU `grep`
to output lines even from files that appear to be binary, use the
-a or ‘--binary-files=text’ option.
To eliminate the
“Binary file matches” messages, use the -I or
‘--binary-files=without-match’ option.

-  Why doesn’t ‘grep -lv’ print non-matching file names?

‘grep -lv’ lists the names of all files containing one or more
lines that do not match.
To list the names of all files that contain no
matching lines, use the -L or --files-without-match
option.

-  I can do “OR” with ‘|’, but what about “AND”?

grep 'paul' /etc/motd | grep 'franc,ois'

finds all lines that contain both ‘paul’ and ‘franc,ois’.

-  Why does the empty pattern match every input line?

The `grep` command searches for lines that contain strings
that match a pattern.  Every line contains the empty string, so an
empty pattern causes `grep` to find a match on each line.  It
is not the only such pattern: ‘^’, ‘$’, and many
other patterns cause `grep` to match every line.

To match empty lines, use the pattern ‘^$’.  To match blank
lines, use the pattern ‘^[[:blank:]]*$’.  To match no lines at
all, use an extended regular expression like ‘a^’ or ‘$a’.
To match every line, a portable script should use a pattern like
‘^’ instead of the empty pattern, as POSIX does not specify the
behavior of the empty pattern.

-  How can I search in both standard input and in files?

Use the special file name ‘-’:

cat /etc/passwd | grep 'alain' - /etc/motd

-  Why can’t I combine the shell’s ‘set -e’ with `grep`?

The `grep` command follows the convention of programs like
`cmp` and `diff` where an exit status of 1 is not an
error.  The shell command ‘set -e’ causes the shell to exit if
any subcommand exits with nonzero status, and this will cause the
shell to exit merely because `grep` selected no lines,
which is ordinarily not what you want.

There is a related problem with Bash’s `set -e -o pipefail`.
Since `grep` does not always read all its input, a command
outputting to a pipe read by `grep` can fail when
`grep` exits before reading all its input, and the command’s
failure can cause Bash to exit.

-  Why is this back-reference failing?

echo 'ba' | grep -E '(a)\1|b\1'

This outputs an error message, because the second ‘\1’
has nothing to refer back to, meaning it will never match anything.

-  How can I match across lines?

Standard grep cannot do this, as it is fundamentally line-based.
Therefore, merely using the `[:space:]` character class does not
match newlines in the way you might expect.

With the GNU `grep` option -z (--null-data), each
input and output “line” is null-terminated; see [Other Options](#Other-Options).  Thus,
you can match newlines in the input, but typically if there is a match
the entire input is output, so this usage is often combined with
output-suppressing options like -q, e.g.:

printf 'foo\nbar\n' | grep -z -q 'foo[[:space:]]\+bar'

If this does not suffice, you can transform the input
before giving it to `grep`, or turn to `awk`,
`sed`, `perl`, or many other utilities that are
designed to operate across lines.

-  What do `grep`, -E, and -F stand for?

The name `grep` comes from the way line editing was done on Unix.
For example,
`ed` uses the following syntax
to print a list of matching lines on the screen:

global/regular expression/print
g/re/p

The -E option stands for Extended `grep`.
The -F option stands for Fixed `grep`;

-  What happened to `egrep` and `fgrep`?

7th Edition Unix had commands `egrep` and `fgrep`
that were the counterparts of the modern ‘grep -E’ and ‘grep -F’.
Although breaking up `grep` into three programs was perhaps
useful on the small computers of the 1970s, `egrep` and
`fgrep` were deemed obsolescent by POSIX in 1992,
removed from POSIX in 2001, deprecated by GNU Grep 2.5.3 in 2007,
and changed to issue obsolescence warnings by GNU Grep 3.8 in 2022;
eventually, they are planned to be removed entirely.

If you prefer the old names, you can use your own substitutes,
such as a shell script named `egrep` with the following
contents:

#!/bin/sh
exec grep -E "$@"

## 5 Performance[ ¶](#Performance-1)

Typically `grep` is an efficient way to search text.  However,
it can be quite slow in some cases, and it can search large files
where even minor performance tweaking can help significantly.
Although the algorithm used by `grep` is an implementation
detail that can change from release to release, understanding its
basic strengths and weaknesses can help you improve its performance.

The `grep` command operates partly via a set of automata that
are designed for efficiency, and partly via a slower matcher that
takes over when the fast matchers run into unusual features like
back-references.  When feasible, the Boyer–Moore fast string
searching algorithm is used to match a single fixed pattern, and the
Aho–Corasick algorithm is used to match multiple fixed patterns.

Generally speaking `grep` operates more efficiently in
single-byte locales, since it can avoid the special processing needed
for multi-byte characters.  If your patterns will work just as well
that way, setting `LC_ALL` to a single-byte locale can help
performance considerably.  Setting ‘LC_ALL='C'’ can be
particularly efficient, as `grep` is tuned for that locale.

Outside the ‘C’ locale, case-insensitive search, and search for
bracket expressions like ‘[a-z]’ and ‘[[=a=]b]’, can be
surprisingly inefficient due to difficulties in fast portable access to
concepts like multi-character collating elements.

Interval expressions may be implemented internally via repetition.
For example, ‘^(a|bc){2,4}$’ might be implemented as
‘^(a|bc)(a|bc)((a|bc)(a|bc)?)?$’.  A large repetition count may
exhaust memory or greatly slow matching.  Even small counts can cause
problems if cascaded; for example, ‘grep -E
".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"’ is likely to overflow a
stack.  Fortunately, regular expressions like these are typically
artificial, and cascaded repetitions do not conform to POSIX so cannot
be used in portable programs anyway.

A back-reference such as ‘\1’ can hurt performance significantly
in some cases, since back-references cannot in general be implemented
via a finite state automaton, and instead trigger a backtracking
algorithm that can be quite inefficient.  For example, although the
pattern ‘^(.*)\1{14}(.*)\2{13}$’ matches only lines whose
lengths can be written as a sum 15x + 14y for nonnegative
integers x and y, the pattern matcher does not perform
linear Diophantine analysis and instead backtracks through all
possible matching strings, using an algorithm that is exponential in
the worst case.

On some operating systems that support files with holes—large
regions of zeros that are not physically present on secondary
storage—`grep` can skip over the holes efficiently without
needing to read the zeros.  This optimization is not available if the
-a (--binary-files=text) option is used (see [File and Directory Selection](#File-and-Directory-Selection)), unless the -z (--null-data)
option is also used (see [Other Options](#Other-Options)).

For efficiency `grep` does not always read all its input.
For example, the shell command ‘sed '/^...$/d' | grep -q X’ can
cause `grep` to exit immediately after reading a line
containing ‘X’, without bothering to read the rest of its input data.
This in turn can cause `sed` to exit with a nonzero status because
`sed` cannot write to its output pipe after `grep` exits.

### 6.1 Known Bugs[ ¶](#Known-Bugs-1)

Large repetition counts in the ‘{n,m}’ construct may cause
`grep` to use lots of memory.
In addition, certain other
obscure regular expressions require exponential time and
space, and may cause `grep` to run out of memory.

Back-references can greatly slow down matching, as they can generate
exponentially many matching possibilities that can consume both time
and memory to explore.  Also, the POSIX specification for
back-references is at times unclear.  Furthermore, many regular
expression implementations have back-reference bugs that can cause
programs to return incorrect answers or even crash, and fixing these
bugs has often been low-priority: for example, as of 2021 the
[GNU C library bug database](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/)
contained back-reference bugs
[52](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52),
[10844](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10844),

and [25322](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25322),
with little sign of forthcoming fixes.  Luckily,
back-references are rarely useful and it should be little trouble to
avoid them in practical applications.

## 7 Copying[ ¶](#Copying-1)

GNU `grep` is licensed under the GNU GPL, which makes it free
software.

The “free” in “free software” refers to liberty, not price.  As
some GNU project advocates like to point out, think of “free speech”
rather than “free beer”.  In short, you have the right (freedom) to
run and change `grep` and distribute it to other people, and—if you
want—charge money for doing either.  The important restriction is
that you have to grant your recipients the same rights and impose the
same restrictions.

This general method of licensing software is sometimes called
open source.  The GNU project prefers the term “free software”
for reasons outlined at
[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html).

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

-  PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document free in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

-  APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

-  VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

-  COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

-  MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

-  Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

-  List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

-  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

-  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

-  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

-  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

-  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.

-  Include an unaltered copy of this License.

-  Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

-  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

-  For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

-  Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

-  Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

-  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

-  Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

-  COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

-  COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

-  AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

-  TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

-  TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

-  FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

-  RELICENSING

“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

### ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents[ ¶](#ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents)

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

  Copyright (C)  year  your name.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being list their titles, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being list, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being list.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
